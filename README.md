# Strix
Custom STM32-Based flight computer to gather data from IMUs, altimeters, and GPS, and control in-flight pyrotechnic events. The software running on this board was created in STM32CubeMX, and stored in a different repository.

This repository contains KiCAD schematics and layouts for this flight computer. The schematics use hierarchical schematic sheets, with sheets defined for the microcontroller, sensors/data storage, pyrotechnic channels, connectors, and power supply.
