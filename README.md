Custom STM32-Based flight computer to gather data from IMUs, altimeters, and GPS, and control in-flight pyrotechnic events.

This repository contains KiCAD schematics and layouts for this flight computer. The schematics are split into several different subsheets, with the master sheet containing an STM32 Microcontroller, with subsheets for power supply circuitry, sensors, pyrotechnic channels, and ports/interfaces.
